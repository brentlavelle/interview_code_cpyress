# Interview Code in Cypress
I'd like to try out cypress to test this form
https://csb-idv4r.netlify.com/

## Installation and running
I'm not 100% on this but I think this will run the tests in
what appears to be a Chrome browser.

* Make sure you have node and npm on your machine
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run Cypress ` ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`
* When the Cypress app starts up click "Run all specs" in the
upper right.
